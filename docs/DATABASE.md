## Overview

We use Prisma as our ORM and database migration tool, providing:
- Type-safe database queries
- Automated schema management
- Migration version control
- Comprehensive seeding functionality
- Rollback capabilities
- Testing framework

## Schema Management

```prisma
// prisma/schema.prisma
model Carrier {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String   @db.VarChar(255)
  mcNumber  String?  @map("mc_number")
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  @@map("carriers")
}
```

## Migration Best Practices

1. **Version Control**:
```bash
# Use descriptive names for migrations
npm run prisma:migrate:dev --name add_carrier_status_enum
```

2. **Rollback Strategy**:
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:migrate:reset": "prisma migrate reset",
    "prisma:db:rollback": "prisma migrate reset --skip-seed",
    "prisma:migrate:status": "prisma migrate status"
  }
}
```

3. **Enhanced Data Seeding**:
```
prisma/seed/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development.ts   # Full dataset from init.sql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing.ts       # Subset of carriers for tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production.ts    # Core production carriers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seed-utils.ts    # Shared seeding utilities
```

4. **Schema Validation**:
```typescript
// src/lib/db/validateSchema.ts
import { z } from 'zod'

export const CarrierSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  mcNumber: z.string().optional()
})
```

5. **CI/CD Integration**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dev-ci-cd.yml
jobs:
  install-and-build:
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Database Migrations
        run: npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
      
      - name: Generate Prisma Client
        run: npx prisma generate
      
      - name: Seed Development Database
        run: npm run prisma:seed:dev
```

6. **Migration Testing**:
```typescript
// tests/migrations/migration.test.ts
describe('Migrations', () => {
  it('should successfully apply all migrations', async () => {
    const migrations = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM _prisma_migrations`
    expect(migrations).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Development Migrations
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy     # Deploy database migrations
npm run prisma:migrate:rollback   # Rollback the most recent migration
npm run prisma:seed:dev           # Seed development database
npm run prisma:db:reset           # Completely reset database

# Detailed Script Descriptions
prisma:migrate:deploy
  - Executes migration deployment script
  - Uses 'scripts/deploy-migrations.sh'
  - Applies schema changes in production environment

prisma:migrate:rollback
  - Reverts the most recent database migration
  - Uses 'scripts/migration-rollback.sh'
  - Allows undoing the last schema change

prisma:seed:dev
  - Seeds development database with initial data
  - Uses seed script at 'prisma/seed/development.ts'
  - Populates database with development dataset

prisma:db:reset
  - Completely resets the database
  - Drops and recreates database
  - Applies all migrations
  - Runs seed scripts
  - WARNING: Use only in development
```

## CI/CD Workflow

Our CI/CD pipeline is designed to ensure consistent, reliable deployments and testing across all environments.

### Final Desired State

We aim to achieve the following in our CI/CD workflow:

1. **Automated Integration Tests Using Docker Compose**
   - **Consistent Testing Environment**: Utilize Docker Compose in the CI pipeline to spin up services required for integration tests, ensuring consistency with local development environments.
   - **Database Service Health Checks**: Implement health checks to ensure all services, especially the database, are ready before tests run.
   - **Isolation of Test Environment**: Use dedicated test databases that are reset between runs to avoid state leakage between tests.
   - **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimize the CI pipeline to parallelize tests where possible, reducing overall build times.

2. **Automated Migrations Against Development Database**
   - **Continuous Deployment to Dev Environment**: On changes to the Prisma schema or pushes to the `develop` branch, automatically run migrations against the development database hosted on Digital Ocean.
   - **Secure Credential Management**: Use GitHub Secrets to securely store and access database credentials during the CI/CD process.
   - **Deployment Workflow**: Have a dedicated deployment workflow (`deploy-dev.yml`) that handles migrations and deployment steps for the development environment.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation and Collaboration**
   - **Clear Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation outlining the CI/CD processes, testing strategies, and migration procedures.
   - **Team Collaboration**: Ensure all team members are informed and trained on the new systems and workflows to promote effective collaboration.

4. **Robust Migration and Rollback Procedures**
   - **Automated Testing of Migrations**: Before deployment, migrations are thoroughly tested locally and in a staging environment to catch issues early.
   - **Rollback Capability**: Implement reliable rollback procedures in case migrations cause unexpected issues in the development environment.
   - **Version Control and Tracking**: Keep meticulous records of migration versions and changes to facilitate debugging and historical tracking.
### Updated CI/CD Workflow Steps

1. **Dependency Installation**
   - Install project dependencies using `npm ci`.
   - Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.

2. **Build and Test Setup**
   - Build the application using `npm run build`.
   - Use caching strategies for the build output.

3. **Start Services with Docker Compose**
   - Use Docker Compose to spin up required services, including the application and PostgreSQL database.
   - Ensure services are up and healthy before proceeding.

4. **Run Migrations and Seeding**
   - Automatically run database migrations using `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy`.
   - Seed the database with initial data using `npm run prisma:seed:dev`.

5. **Execute Tests**
   - Run integration tests in two parallel jobs:
     1. **API Integration Tests**:
        - Uses Docker Compose with Dockerfile.test
        - Runs `test:api:ci` command in CI environment
        - Uses dedicated test database with health checks
        - Configured via docker-compose.test.yml
     2. **End-to-End Tests**:
        - Uses Cypress GitHub Action
        - Runs `cypress:run` command
        - Tests against running Next.js application
   - Tests are isolated and use dedicated test databases
   - Environment variables are properly configured for each test type

6. **Tear Down Services**
   - After tests are completed, tear down Docker Compose services to clean up resources.

7. **Automated Deployment to Development Environment**
   - On successful tests and builds, automatically deploy to the development environment.
   - Run migrations against the development database on Digital Ocean.
   - Ensure secure handling of environment variables and secrets.

## Local Development and Testing

### Quick Start

For detailed instructions on local database management, testing, and troubleshooting, refer to our [Local Database Testing Guide](DATABASE_LOCAL_TESTING.md).

#### Key Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:generate

# Run Migrations
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy

# Seed Development Database
npm run prisma:seed:dev

# Reset Database
npm run prisma:db:reset
```

### Testing Workflow

1. Ensure local PostgreSQL is running.
2. Configure `.env` with `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Follow steps in Local Database Testing Guide.
4. Verify database state and migrations.

### Troubleshooting Prisma Connection Issues

If you encounter Prisma connection errors, particularly with port configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Check Environment Variable Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Check if DATABASE_URL is set in your shell
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   
   # If it shows an unexpected value or wrong port, unset it
   unset DATABASE_URL
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: If Prisma is not using the configuration from your `.env` files, there might be a DATABASE_URL environment variable set in your shell that's taking precedence. This can cause connection errors, particularly with port numbers.

2. **Force Specific Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Run Prisma commands with explicit DATABASE_URL
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db_name npx prisma migrate reset --force
   ```

3. **Common Issues**:
   - If Prisma tries to connect to port 5433 when your database is on 5432:
     1. Check for DATABASE_URL in your shell environment
     2. Unset it if present
     3. Ensure your `.env` and `.env.test.local` files specify the correct port
     4. Verify the port matches your docker-compose configuration

### Environment Configuration Verification

Before running any database commands, ensure that your environment configuration is consistent:

1. **Check Port Configuration**
   - Verify that the port specified in your Docker Compose files matches the port in your environment files
   - The default configuration uses:
     ```bash
     # docker-compose.test.local.yml
     ports:
       - "5432:5432"   # Host:Container ports

     # .env and .env.test.local
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db_name
     ```
   - If you modify the port in Docker Compose, ensure you update all relevant environment files

2. **Verify Environment Files**
   - Check both `.env` and `.env.test.local` for consistent configuration
   - Environment-specific files take precedence over the base `.env` file
   - Common issues include mismatched ports or credentials between files

3. **Test Database Connection**
   - Before running migrations, verify the database is accessible:
     ```bash
     # Start the database container
     docker compose -f docker-compose.test.local.yml up -d

     # Wait for the database to be ready
     sleep 5

     # Run migrations and seeding
     npm run prisma:db:reset
     npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
     npm run prisma:seed:dev
     ```

## Target System Architecture

Our goal is to have a robust, automated, and efficient system for managing database migrations and testing within our CI/CD pipeline and development workflow.

Key components of the target system include:

- **Automated CI Integration Tests Using Docker Compose**
  - Utilize Docker Compose to replicate the development environment in CI.
  - Run integration tests in an environment that closely mirrors production.

- **Continuous Deployment and Migrations**
  - Automatically deploy code changes and database migrations to the development environment.
  - Ensure that the development database stays in sync with the latest schema changes.

- **Improved Testing Workflow**
  - Use isolated test databases to prevent state contamination.
  - Reset databases between test runs for consistency.
  - Parallelize tests where possible to optimize build times.

- **Enhanced Documentation and Collaboration**
  - Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of all processes.
  - Facilitate team training and knowledge sharing.

By implementing these systems, we aim to streamline our development processes, reduce potential errors, and improve overall efficiency.
