# Trucking Brokers
A trucking broker is a company that arranges transportation for shippers and carriers. They can be either a broker-only company or a broker-carrier company.

## AI Agent Prompt
When implementing the brokers domain follow the best practices outlined in 

* [PROMPT_BEST_PRACTICES.md](docs/prompts/PROMPT_BEST_PRACTICES.md) document
* [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) document

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Domain Model and API Development
1. Create Domain Types
   - [x] Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/domains/brokers/types.ts`
     * Broker interface implemented
     * Load interface implemented
     * Carrier interface implemented
     * Shipper interface implemented
     * Factor interface implemented
   - [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for domain types in `tests/brokers-types.test.ts`
     * Validated interface structures
     * Tested type compatibility
     * Ensured type safety for broker-related interfaces
     * Verified required and optional properties
     * Checked enum and union type constraints
     * Added Jest type definitions for robust testing
     * Implemented flexible optional property testing

2. Develop API Routes
   - [x] Implement `src/app/api/brokers/route.ts`
     * Uses PostgreSQL connection pool (pg)
     * Implemented GET method to list brokers
     * Implemented POST method to create new brokers
     * Includes robust error handling
     * Validates broker type and required fields
   - [x] Implement `src/app/api/brokers/[id]/route.ts`
     * Created GET method to fetch specific broker
     * Added PUT method to update broker details
     * Implemented DELETE method to remove brokers
     * Uses direct SQL queries
   - [x] Create comprehensive API route tests in `tests/brokers.test.ts`
     * Tested database connection and brokers table
     * Validated GET /api/brokers endpoint
     * Tested POST /api/brokers for broker creation
     * Implemented PUT /api/brokers/<id> update tests
     * Created DELETE /api/brokers/<id> deletion tests
     * Includes error handling and edge case coverage
     * Added data cleanup mechanism to ensure test isolation
   - [x] Passed comprehensive API tests in `tests/brokers-api.test.ts`
     * Verified API endpoint functionality
     * Confirmed robust error handling
     * Validated data retrieval and manipulation
     * Ensured consistent API behavior across different operations

3. Database Schema Considerations
   - [x] Prepare SQL schema for brokers table
     * Included columns: id, name, contact_email, contact_phone, type
     * Defined appropriate data types and constraints in `init.sql`
     * Used PostgreSQL ENUM for broker type
   - [x] Ensured consistent naming conventions with existing database schema
   - [x] Create database schema validation tests
     * Verified table structure
     * Tested column constraints
     * Validated data type mappings
     * Existing tests in `tests/brokers.test.ts` provide comprehensive schema validation

4. Create API Client Functions
   - [ ] Develop `src/domains/brokers/api.ts`
     * Create methods for fetching brokers
     * Implement load-related API methods
     * Add methods for carrier, shipper, and factor retrieval
     * Ensure error handling for API calls
   - [ ] Develop comprehensive tests for API client functions
     * Unit tests for each API method
     * Test error handling scenarios
     * Validate data transformation and retrieval

5. Create React Query Hooks
   - [ ] Develop `src/domains/brokers/hooks.ts`
     * Implement hooks for brokers list and individual broker
     * Create hooks for loads, carriers, shippers, and factors
     * Add mutation hook for creating loads
   - [ ] Create tests for React Query hooks
     * Test hook behavior
     * Validate data fetching and mutation
     * Ensure proper state management

### Phase 2: Advanced Broker Management
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Develop comprehensive reporting features
- [ ] Create user role-based access controls
- [ ] Integrate with external transportation management systems

### Phase 3: Performance and Scalability
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms
- [ ] Develop load balancing strategies
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting systems

### Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] Develop predictive load matching algorithms
- [ ] Implement risk assessment models
- [ ] Create intelligent pricing recommendations
- [ ] Build carrier performance analytics

### Phase 5: Mobile and Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] Develop responsive web interface
- [ ] Create mobile application for iOS and Android
- [ ] Implement cross-platform synchronization
- [ ] Develop offline mode capabilities

## Future Considerations
- Blockchain integration for transparent transaction tracking
- AI-powered route optimization
- Real-time tracking and geolocation services
- Advanced analytics and business intelligence dashboards

## Compliance and Security
- GDPR and data protection compliance
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Regular security audits
- Encryption of sensitive data
