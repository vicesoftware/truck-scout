# Database & Migrations

This document outlines our database migration strategy and implementation details using Prisma ORM.

## Overview

We use Prisma as our ORM and database migration tool, providing:
- Type-safe database queries
- Automated schema management
- Migration version control
- Comprehensive seeding functionality
- Rollback capabilities
- Testing framework

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Install Prisma dependencies
2. Initialize Prisma schema based on existing carriers table
3. Create initial migration with descriptive name
4. Set up schema validation with Zod
5. Configure Prisma client instance
6. Configure seeding strategy
   - Create seed directory structure
   - Implement seed-utils with carrier data from init.sql
   - Create development seed file with full dataset
   - Create testing seed file with subset

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Update API routes to use Prisma client
   - Implement CRUD operations in /api/carriers route
   - Add transaction support for multi-step operations
   - Implement proper error handling with Prisma errors
   - Add input validation using existing Zod schemas
2. Complete seeding implementation
   - Create production seed file
   - Add npm scripts for environment-specific seeding
   - Add seed versioning for tracking data changes
3. Update tests to work with Prisma
   - Update carriers.test.ts to use Prisma client
   - Add database cleanup using Prisma
   - Add integration test suite for Prisma operations
   - Create mock Prisma client for unit tests
   - Add database transaction tests

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Database Reset and Seeding Improvements
   - Added `prisma:db:reset` npm script
   - Implemented duplicate prevention in seeding
   - Added unique constraints to prevent data duplication
   - Created robust database reset mechanism

### üìù Todo (Streamlined Migration Strategy)

- [x] Add migration dry-run in GitHub Actions
- [x] Implement automatic schema validation
- [x] Create deployment approval process for schema changes
- [x] Update GitHub workflow to include Prisma migration checks

#### 2. Production Migration Deployment üöß
- [x] Create clear migration process for Digital Ocean
- [x] Document step-by-step migration workflow
- [x] Implement basic rollback mechanism script
- [x] Create deployment script for Prisma migrations
- [ ] Enhance migration performance monitoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Complete testing of migration scripts

#### 3. Seed Data Management
- [x] Implement duplicate prevention in seeding
- [ ] Create script to sync seed data between environments
- [ ] Implement versioning for seed data
- [ ] Add data integrity checks for seed scripts

#### 4. Performance and Monitoring
- [ ] Add basic database performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Create database health check endpoint
- [ ] Set up logging for database operations
- [ ] Configure database connection timeout and retry strategies
