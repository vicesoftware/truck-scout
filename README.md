## Overview

Truck Scout TMS is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project integrated with [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) and PostgreSQL. It uses Docker for database management.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   DATABASE_URI=postgres://tms_user:secure_password_here@localhost:5432/tms_db
   PAYLOAD_SECRET=your_long_random_string_here
   ```
   Replace the values with your desired settings. Note that the database credentials in the `DATABASE_URI` should match those defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Database Setup

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. Review the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure the database and pgAdmin settings match your preferences. The file should contain environment variables for:
   - `POSTGRES_DB`
   - `POSTGRES_USER`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
   - `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`
   - `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`

3. Start the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will also automatically seed the database with sample carrier data.

4. Verify the containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

5. Access pgAdmin:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5050`
   - Log in using the email and password set in the `docker-compose.yml` file

6. Connect to the PostgreSQL database in pgAdmin:
   - Right-click on "Servers" in the left panel and select "Create" > "Server"
   - In the "General" tab, name your server (e.g., "TMS Database")
   - In the "Connection" tab, enter:
     - Host name/address: tms_postgres
     - Port: 5432
     - Maintenance database: (the value of POSTGRES_DB from docker-compose.yml)
     - Username: (the value of POSTGRES_USER from docker-compose.yml)
     - Password: (the value of POSTGRES_PASSWORD from docker-compose.yml)

## Payload CMS Setup

1. Ensure the `payload.config.js` file is properly configured with your collections and settings.

2. The first time you run the application, Payload will automatically set up the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the main application.

3. Access the Payload CMS admin panel at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

4. On first run, you'll be prompted to create an admin user for Payload CMS.

## Git Flow

We use Git Flow for managing our development workflow. Git Flow provides a structured branching model that helps streamline the process of feature development, releases, and hotfixes.

### Git Flow Overview

Git Flow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. For a comprehensive overview of the Git Flow model, refer to [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### Working with Features

To start working on a new feature:

1. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git flow feature start feature_name
   ```
   <details>
   <summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

   The `git flow feature start` command is a convenience wrapper that executes the following Git commands under the hood:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/feature_name
   ```

   This creates a new branch off of the develop branch with the prefix "feature/".
   </details>

2. Work on your feature, committing changes as usual.

3. When the feature is complete, finish it:
   ```bash
   git flow feature finish feature_name
   ```
   <details>
   <summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff feature/feature_name
   git branch -d feature/feature_name
   ```
   </details>

This will merge the feature branch into `develop` and delete the feature branch.

### Releases and Hotfixes

For creating releases and hotfixes, refer to the [Git Flow Command Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/JamesMGreene/cdd0ac49f90c987e45ac). This resource provides a side-by-side comparison of Git Flow commands and their equivalent raw Git commands, which is particularly helpful for developers familiar with Git but new to Git Flow.

Here are some common Git Flow commands for releases and hotfixes, along with their Git equivalents:

#### Creating a Release

```bash
git flow release start 1.0.0
```
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```
</details>

#### Finishing a Release

```bash
git flow release finish 1.0.0
```
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git branch -d release/1.0.0
```
</details>

#### Starting a Hotfix

```bash
git flow hotfix start 1.0.1
```
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1
```
</details>

#### Finishing a Hotfix

```bash
git flow hotfix finish 1.0.1
```
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Equivalent Git commands</summary>

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git branch -d hotfix/1.0.1
```
</details>

### Best Practices

- Always create feature branches from the `develop` branch.
- Keep feature branches short-lived and focused on a single feature or task.
- Regularly pull changes from `develop` into your feature branch to stay up-to-date.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for your feature branches.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Note: When deploying, ensure you set up the necessary environment variables in your deployment platform.
